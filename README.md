# Custom Password Generator

In this video, I showcase a custom password generator built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**. This tool allows users to easily generate secure passwords with adjustable settings for length, numbers, symbols, and case sensitivity. Additionally, Iâ€™ve implemented a copy-to-clipboard functionality with a tooltip notification to enhance user experience. This project is perfect for anyone looking to improve their password management system.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Password Length and Characters**: Tailor your password to meet security requirements by adjusting length and character options.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard with Tooltip Confirmation**: Easily copy generated passwords with instant confirmation via tooltip notifications.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: The user interface is crafted with **TailwindCSS**, ensuring a sleek and responsive experience across devices.
- **Password History Tracking**: Keep track of previously generated passwords for your convenience.
